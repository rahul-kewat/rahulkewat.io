- **Be Selective:** Don’t just take any client—look for clients whose values align with yours and who are willing to pay for quality.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Spreading Yourself Too Thin:** Focus on a few platforms and methods that work best for you rather than trying to be everywhere at once.
- **Ignoring Red Flags:** If a client seems disorganized, unwilling to pay fair rates, or unclear about project scope, it might be best to walk away.
- **Undervaluing Your Work:** High-quality clients are willing to pay for value. Don’t sell yourself short by accepting low rates or compromising on your standards.
