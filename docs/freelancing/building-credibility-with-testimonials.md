- **Make It Easy:** Provide a simple format or specific questions to guide the client, such as asking about the results achieved, the experience of working with you, and the quality of your communication.

### 2. **Leverage LinkedIn Recommendations**

- **Connect with Clients:** Encourage clients to leave recommendations on LinkedIn, which can then be shared on your freelancing profiles and website.
- **Highlight Specific Skills:** Ask clients to focus on particular skills or aspects of the project that showcase your strengths.

### 3. **Offer Incentives for Feedback**

- **Discounts or Extras:** Offer a small discount or an additional service as a thank you for providing a testimonial.
