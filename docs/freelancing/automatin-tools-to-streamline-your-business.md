Freelancing involves juggling multiple tasks, from managing clients and projects to handling finances and marketing. Automation tools can help streamline these tasks, saving you time and reducing the risk of errors. Here’s how to leverage automation to run your freelancing business more efficiently.

## Why Use Automation Tools?
